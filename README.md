# EasyGenerator-Assessment

I have used Page Object Model and created methods for every element used.

I have not worked on this part before - Create an npm script to run the task.html file on a localhost.
So I have left the cy.visit() command empty.

I have written testcases by using basic Cypress 'describe' and 'it' keywords.

As there was shortage of time due to my project release, I have not used Cucumber BDD Framework.

I can offer a lot to the organization if given a chance, I can work hard and learn what I am not aware of :)

Thank you
